description: Preparing to use an LG Ultrawide Monitor with your Mac.
---

I decided to try an ultrawide monitor to bring some change (and even excitement) to my work-from-home daily grind. I
figure that now is the opportunity to try some of the more extreme productivity gear out there, and maybe even have
some fun with it. So I went all-out:
[the 49", 32:9, 5120x1440 curved ultrawide display from LG](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-49WL95C-W-ultrawide-monitor#)
(its real name is the LG 49WL95C-W but I figure that doesn't really mean anything to anyone but the manufacturer).

What do I think? It's a luxury item. Totally unnecessary. I couldn't possibly recommend it: the price is exorbitant
and there's just no way a monitor could justify the cost. It does have some really handy features though:
- it operates as a KVM: you can plug in two computers, one keyboard, and one mouse, and control both computers with the
same peripherals.
- you can even split the screen in half: one side for each computer.
- speakers (not great but not terrible)
- a USB-C port (and cable!) that transfers video, audio, USB peripherals, and enough power to charge your MacBook Pro
- it is *huge*.

An important grievance:
- the power cable is too short to be useful. You'll need to [buy another](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0728CMZSY).

To summarize: I think it makes sense for enthusiasts who like the way it looks and don't mind spending money on
unnecessary tech.

Now let's get to the real point of this post: what all is involved in setting it up to use with your Mac:


# Connection

As I mentioned earlier, the monitor works as a KVM. Even if you're only connecting one machine (e.g. one MacBook Pro),
that still means that you should plug all your peripherals into the monitor and then connect the monitor to your
machine. The monitor's USB-C port and USB-C cable work great for this. It will even charge your MacBook Pro!


# Resolution

This is the tricky part: the monitor's resolution is 5120x1440. That's not exactly a common standard. If you use the
common resolution controls on a Mac (*System Preferences -> Displays*):
