If you want to watch ESPN, you're going to need a cable subscription. Even if you just want to use the
[app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/espn-live-sports-scores/id317469184).

Depending on where you live, that may mean subscribing to Xfinity. This isn't great: the folks at Xfinity are
making it harder and harder to get access to streaming content like that on the ESPN app.

Fortunately, I seem to have discovered a way through. Here's my process to use the ESPN app with an Xfinity
subscription:

1. Open the ESPN App on your phone with WiFi disabled. It's important that you start a stream on cellular data, we'll
switch to WiFi later.
1. Select some content to stream.
1. If you're not already logged in with some TV provider, the app will ask you to. Go through the process for Xfinity.
1. The stream should start. Now go to your phone's settings, turn on WiFi, and connect to the network of your choice.

# What if I want to watch on my smart TV?
You may have a smart TV with an ESPN app installed. Unfortunately, if you try to use your Xfinity subscription with
the smart TV app, it's probably going to tell you that your Xfinity plan doesn't include ESPN content.

Don't believe that error message. All it really means is that you can't use the ESPN app on a smart TV. You have to use
the app on your phone, following the instructions above, and then "cast" the stream to your TV via a *Chromecast* device.

If you don't have a Chromecast device, check to see if your TV has built-in support. Otherwise, you can go for [this
more affordable, basic option](https://store.google.com/us/config/chromecast?hl=en-US). But I highly recommend trying
[the complete Google TV experience](https://store.google.com/us/config/chromecast_google_tv?hl=en-US) for a little
more.

# Conclusion
And that's it! It's frustrating to have to jump through so many hoops just to watch ESPN, even after paying for a
cable subscription. But I'm thankful there's still a way.

I'm sure that Xfinity will continue to make viewing streaming content more and more complex - all they really want is
for us to buy cable subscriptions and watch live TV via their set-top boxes.

So I really hope that networks like ESPN provide a way around the cable giants, so that we can watch ESPN without
having to deal with Xfinity. Note that their current ESPN+ offering does not include comprehensive access to ESPN
content, so I'm talking about more than that.

Fingers crossed ðŸ¤ž
