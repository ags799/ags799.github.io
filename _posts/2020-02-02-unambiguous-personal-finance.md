description: Personal finance advice that is specific and achievable.

The goal of personal finance is to have money available to purchase the things we need at all
points in our life. We want cash-in-hand when we're retired, when we're employed,
when we're unemployed, when we're at school, etc. In this post I'll make specific recommendations on
how to maintain ample *liquidity* (money available for immediate spending) throughout your life.

# Priority One: You Need Money Right Now

Before we can realize our dreams tomorrow, we need to survive today. It is a fact of modern life
that we spend money every day, if not every few hours.

The money that we keep readily available for spending (*spending money*) should come from
regular sources of income, like a biweekly paycheck. Spending money should be kept in a checking
account and accessible via ATMs and a debit card.

Choice of a checking account is straightforward:
* must be FDIC-insured (this means you won't lose your money if the bank fails)
* should have ATMs wherever you go
* must not have any fees

This isn't a hard decision: you're not going to have much interaction with the bank that holds your
checking account. As long as you don't spend more money than is in your account, there's nothing
to fear here. It's a good idea to choose a large, well-established retail bank like
[Chase](https://chase.com) since they'll offer a good website, plenty of branches & ATMs, smartphone apps,
and fast transfers.

Note that whichever bank you choose will try to entice you into using them for other financial
needs, like a savings account or investing. Resist the temptation: I will soon recommend specific
financial businesses for handling these needs.

## An Aside: How to Spend Money Effectively

This post is focused on where to keep your money to maintain long-term liquidity. It is worth
mentioning, however, that there's another side to personal finance: how to spend your money
effectively. Spending with cash or a debit card isn't always the right way to go.
*Cash-back credit cards* like
[Capital One Savor](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savor-dining-rewards/) will actually
pay you back a (very) small portion of your expenditures just for using them. Properly using
credit cards is a delicate venture, however, and I'll save the details another post.

# Priority Two: You'll Need Money When You're Unemployed

Once you've paid your monthly expenditures you might find some money left over. There may be some
luxury good or service you'd like to spend it on (no judgment) but if you want to use that money
to prepare for the future, you're going to want to put it in a *savings account*. Why?

Savings accounts are not just checking accounts with a special name. Checking accounts are perfectly
liquid: at any moment you can approach an ATM to convert funds in the account into cash. You can set
them up for direct deposit of your paycheck.

Savings accounts don't always have these features. They aren't as liquid. They do allow you to withdraw
your money on-demand, though. That makes them good emergency funds for when you lose your job or have a
medical emergency. And most importantly, they carry *interest*.

Interest is the money that a bank will pay you for keeping your money with them. It's defined as a percentage
of the money you keep with them. The higher the percentage, the more money they'll pay you. So when choosing
a savings account, we look for two things:
* must be FDIC-insured (as usual)
* should have the highest possible interest rate

I can make a very specific recommendation about which savings account to use: the
[Wealthfront Cash Account](https://www.wealthfront.com/cash). Wealthfront keeps its interest rate as high
as possible, is FDIC-insured, and only requires $1 to start.

That's right: **if you have $1 to spare, you can start a high-interest savings account right now**.

So start your Wealthfront Cash Account now and keep depositing your spare cash. Ideally, your savings
account will cover
3-6 months expenditures, so if you are suddenly unemployed, you have 3-6 months to find a new job before
your money runs out. The exact number of months to save for depends on your job: if it's easy to find a
new job, only save for 3. If it's hard, save for 6.

On top of that, you can add money you're saving for a specific purpose, like a down payment on a house or
car. Just make sure you keep the 3-6 months cushion available and you'll be in great shape.
