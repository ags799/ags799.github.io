The goal of personal finance is to have money available to purchase the things we need at all
points in our life. We want cash-in-hand when we're retired, when we're employed,
when we're unemployed, when we're at school, etc. In this post I'll make specific recommendations on
how to maintain ample *liquidity* (money available for immediate spending) throughout your life.

# Priority One: You Need Money Right Now
Before we can realize our dreams tomorrow, we need to survive today. It is a fact of modern life
that we spend money every day, if not every few hours.

The money that we keep readily available for spending (*spending money*) should come from
regular sources of income, like a biweekly paycheck. Spending money should be kept in a checking
account and accessible via ATMs and a debit card.

Choice of a checking account is straightforward:
* must be FDIC-insured (this means you won't lose your money if the bank fails)
* should have ATMs wherever you go
* must not have any fees

## Which Do I Choose?
This isn't a hard decision: you're not going to have much interaction with the bank that holds your
checking account. As long as you don't spend more money than is in your account, there's nothing
to fear here. It's a good idea to choose a large, well-established retail bank like
[Chase](https://chase.com) since they'll offer a good website, plenty of branches & ATMs, smartphone apps,
and fast transfers.

Note that whichever bank you choose will try to entice you into using them for other financial
needs, like a savings account or investing. Resist the temptation: I will soon recommend specific
financial businesses for handling these needs.

## An Aside: How to Spend Money Effectively

This post is focused on where to keep your money to maintain long-term liquidity. It is worth
mentioning, however, that there's another side to personal finance: how to spend your money
effectively. Spending with cash or a debit card isn't always the right way to go.
*Cash-back credit cards* will actually
pay you back a (very) small portion of your expenditures just for using them. Properly using
credit cards is a delicate venture, however, and I'll save the details another post.

# Priority Two: You'll Need Money When You're Unemployed
Once you've paid your monthly expenditures you might find some money left over. There may be some
luxury good or service you'd like to spend it on (no judgment) but if you want to use that money
to prepare for the future, you're going to want to put it in a *savings account*. Why?

Savings accounts are not just checking accounts with a special name. Checking accounts are perfectly
liquid: at any moment you can approach an ATM to convert funds in the account into cash. You can set
them up for direct deposit of your paycheck.

Savings accounts don't always have these features. They aren't as liquid. They do allow you to withdraw
your money on-demand, though. That makes them good emergency funds for when you lose your job or have a
medical emergency. And most importantly, they carry *interest*.

Interest is the money that a bank will pay you for keeping your money with them. It's defined as a percentage
of the money you keep with them. The higher the percentage, the more money they'll pay you. So when choosing
a savings account, we look for two things:
* must be FDIC-insured (as usual)
* should have the highest possible interest rate

## Which Do I Choose?
I can make a very specific recommendation about which savings account to use: the
[Wealthfront Cash Account](https://www.wealthfront.com/cash). Wealthfront keeps its interest rate as high
as possible, is FDIC-insured, and only requires $1 to start.

That's right: **if you have $1 to spare, you can start a high-interest savings account right now**.

So start your Wealthfront Cash Account now and keep depositing your spare cash. Ideally, your savings
account will cover
3-6 months expenditures, so if you are suddenly unemployed, you have 3-6 months to find a new job before
your money runs out. The exact number of months to save for depends on your job: if it's easy to find a
new job, only save for 3. If it's hard, save for 6.

On top of that, you can add money you're saving for a specific purpose, like a down payment on a house or
car. Just make sure you keep the 3-6 months cushion available and you'll be in great shape.

# Priority Three: You'll Need Money When You Can't Work Anymore (Retirement)
If you've come this far: congratulations. You're comfortably paying your monthly expenses and you've got
an emergency fund for when things go awry. But what do you do with the money left over?

As usual, maybe there's some luxury item you're looking to pick up (no judgment). But if that's not the case,
it's important that we put this money to work for us in a way that our high-interest savings account can't.
We aren't concerned about liquidity at this point: we're already covering our monthly expenses with our
checking account and we have an emergency fund on top of that. We're really just looking for a higher
interest rate, or a better *rate of return* (means the same thing).

There are countless investment offerings, and you've probably heard of some of them: "stocks", "bonds",
"mutual funds", and "ETFs". Each offers a unique balance of three factors:
* rate of return (we want to maximize this)
* liquidity (we also want to maximize this, but it's not so important)
* risk (we want to minimize this)
* taxes (we want to minimize these)

## Which Do I Choose?
None of those things. Something else. You've probably heard of it and are probably confused by it: a 401(k). Let's start
by clearing some things up:
* **Why is it called a 401(k)?** I don't know, it doesn't matter.
* **What is the (k) for?** See above.
* **Why is it good?** Tax reasons. It's not important that you understand why. If you want to know more, search
elsewhere.
* **Why is it bad?** You can't use the money until you're retired (65 years old), and there's a limit to how
much money you can put into it. Also it has a weird name.

If waiting for the money until you're 65 sounds lame, it is. But use this to your advantage. You're not going
to put all of your money into a 401(k). But the money that you do put in will remain behind-the-scenes, growing
steadily, and waiting for you when you're finally ready to put your feet up. Putting money into a 401(k) is a
good feeling.

## How Do I Start?
401(k)s are prepared by employers and provided to their employees. If your employer doesn't offer a 401(k),
they better have a good reason why. 401(k)s are pretty fundamental to benefits plans.

The details of your 401(k) are employer-specific, but you should be able to get the details from your HR department,
or by asking your manager. Don't be shy about this: 401(k) plans are very common and very important to *everyone*.

Your employer will need you to answer a few questions before you set up your plan:

### Which fund do you want your money to go into?
There's probably going to be a *lot* of options here. You can ignore almost all of them. You're looking for
something like "Target Retirement Fund 2060", where "2060" is around the year you turn 65 (or whenever you expect
to retire). It might be called a "Vanguard Target Retirement Fund" or "Fidelity Target Retirement Fund", either
one is fine (both Vanguard and Fidelity are respectable financial companies).

### (Optional) Roth or 401(k)?
Some businesses only offer their employees a 401(k) plan. Some offer a Roth too. If your employer doesn't offer a
Roth option, move on to the next section. If you have a Roth option: read on.

The difference between Roth and traditional 401(k) is actually pretty complicated. It's all about taxes. I'll try
to simplify though:
* if you expect your tax rate to be higher when you retire than it is now, go with Roth
* if you expect your tax rate to be lower when you retire than it is now, go with 401(k)
* if you aren't sure, there's nothing wrong with putting half your money into a Roth and half into a 401(k)

Roth generally makes sense. Unless you're making a ton of money in your current position, you're probably going
to pay a higher tax rate when you're retired. Maybe because your income will be higher then, or maybe because
taxes will generally be higher in the future.

### How much of your salary do you want to contribute?
This is a really lame question, for multiple reasons. Firstly, they love to use the word "contribute" here,
like when they say "401(k) contributions". When they say "contribute", they just mean that before they write your
paycheck, they will take a part of it and put it into your 401(k). So your paycheck will be smaller because
some of the money went into your 401(k), and you won't be able to get that money until your 65.

Second reason: when people ask this question, they act like you make this decision about your "contribution" and
then you can't change it. That's totally false. You can change your contribution whenever you want. If you
accidentally make it too large then you can just change it for you next paycheck and every paycheck after that.

Third reason: this is just a really hard question for someone to answer, especially if they're new to 401(k)s.
Basically, when you consider how much you want to put into your 401(k), you are answering:
* how much of my paycheck do I need to cover my expenses
* how much do I want to put into a fund that I won't have access to until I'm 65

Those are two very hard questions! Let's make them simpler. We really just need to know how much we're spending
per month. We've already got our emergency fund set up, and if we decide we need some more income later, we
can always reduce our contribution. Ultimately, 401(k)s are great tools for investment because of their tax
incentives (and that's all you need to know). So we want to put as much in as possible.

To determine your monthly expenditures, you could use an app like [Mint](https://mint.com). Or you could just
read your checking account's *monthly statements*. These should show the money that you're spending on rent,
credit cards, etc. Figure out the maximum money you need per month, subtract that from your monthly paycheck,
and the rest can go into your 401(k).

#### But what if they ask for a percentage contribution?
They're morons. It's much easier for you to calculate a dollar amount you want to contribute. Any 401(k) plan
will let you determine a dollar amount to contribute rather than a percentage of your income. Just tell them
the dollar amount, or do it yourself from the 401(k) plan's website.

#### But there's a limit!
Very important! 401(k)s have great tax advantages, so the IRS has to limit how heavily you can use them. In
2020, you're allowed to put $19,500 into your 401(k) plan. If that's a lot, as in way more than you could
possibly put in, don't worry about it. If it's within reach, just make sure you don't put more than $19,500
in! It won't be the end of the world, but you'll pay a penalty when the IRS assesses your taxes.

This brings us to our final point...
