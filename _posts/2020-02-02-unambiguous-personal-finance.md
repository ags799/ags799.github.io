description: Personal finance advice that is specific and achievable.

The goal of personal finance is to have money available to purchase the things we need at all
points in our life. We want cash-in-hand when we're retired, when we're employed,
when we're unemployed, when we're at school, etc. In this post I'll make specific recommendations on
how to maintain ample *liquidity* (money available for immediate spending) throughout your life.

# Priority One: You Need Liquidity Right Now

Before we can realize our dreams tomorrow, we need to survive today. It is a fact of modern life
that we spend money every day, if not every few hours.

The money that we keep readily available for spending (a.k.a. *spending money*) should come from
regular sources of income, like a biweekly paycheck. Spending money should be kept in a checking
account and accessible via ATMs and a debit card.

Choice of a checking account is straightforward:
* must be FDIC-insured (this means you won't lose your money if the bank fails)
* should have ATMs wherever you go
* must not have any fees
This isn't a hard decision: you're not going to have much interaction with the bank that holds your
checking account. As long as you don't spend more money than is in your account, there's nothing
to fear here. It's a good idea to choose a large, well-established retail bank like
[Chase](https://chase.com) since they'll offer a good website, plenty of branches & ATMs, smartphone apps,
and fast transfers.

Note that whichever bank you choose will try to entice you into using them for other financial
needs, like a savings account or investing. Resist the temptation: I will soon recommend specific
financial businesses for handling these needs.

## An Aside: How to Spend Money Effectively

This post is focused on where to keep your money to maintain long-term liquidity. It is worth
mentioning, however, that there's another side to personal finance: how to spend your money most
effectively. Spending with cash or a debit card isn't always the right way to go.
*Cash-back credit cards* like
[Capital One Savor](https://www.capitalone.com/credit-cards/savor-dining-rewards/) will actually
pay you back a (very) small portion of your expenditures just for using them. Properly using
credit cards is a delicate venture, however, and I'll save the details another post.
