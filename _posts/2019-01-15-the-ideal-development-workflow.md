*Work in Progress*

Developing software is like herding cats: the cats are the myriad and sometimes unexpected inputs provided by our users,
and the cowboys are our carefully-designed lines of code, funneling the cats through well-tested call stacks, and
and leaving them with useful output.

We may invent services to provide for a specific use-case, but once we expose these services to the world, we may be
met with thousands of simultaneous requests that carry unforeseen expectations for our products.

We cannot meet these challenges with numbers. Successful software products may have millions of users per engineer.
*The Mythical Man Month* suggests that adding engineers to a product only delays its progress. Each change to a software
service risks crashing the service or opening a security breach. Trying to coordinate large numbers of such changes can
be a losing battle.

However, providing your development team a simple, quick, and consistent workflow could amplify your team's
productivity to meet whatever challenges your user-scale brings. Rather than throwing larger numbers of talent at a
problem, we empower the talent we already have to work more effectively.
