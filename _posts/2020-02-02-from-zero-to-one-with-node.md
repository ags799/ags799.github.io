# What is Node?
`node` is an interpreter, like `python`, `bash`, or `ruby`.

It's unique in that it interprets a language with a different name. That is, while `python` interprets Python
and `bash` interprets Bash, `node` interprets Javascript.

# How Do I Install It?
Like most interpreters, it comes in different versions, so you'll want to install it with a version manager.
The best I know if is [n](https://github.com/tj/n).

# Which Version Do I Use?
I recommend the latest stable version, which you can equip with

    n stable
