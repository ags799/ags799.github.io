In his seminal post
[*Integrated Tests are a 
Scam*](https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/integrated-tests-are-a-scam),
J. B. Rainsberger explains how the completeness of integration (or
"integrated") tests lure developers into a trap.
Integration tests require a complex development environment, they are slow, and
they are imprecise. They cover a broad
swath of your codebase and make it hard to pinpoint buggy code.

However, used sparingly, integration tests are a powerful tool. A limited
number of integration tests that ensure the
proper function of your most common use-cases can catch bugs from unexpected
changes in a dependency. At the very
least, they serve as sanity checks that give developers confidence in a
continuously-deployed (CD) workflow.

In this post I'll explain how you can apply integration tests to your project 
with minimal impact on your workflow. In a follow-up, I'll showcase a great 
tool for avoiding integration tests except when absolutely necessary.

# Firstly, What is an Integration Test?

In my own words,

> An integration test ensures your service uses code from another repository to 
produce expected results.

When testing your own code, you have the freedom to write code that is easily 
testable. E.g., instead of writing a function like

    func NewPersonFromFile(path string) (Person, error)

which can only be tested after creating a file, you could write

    func NewPersonFromFile(contents io.Reader) (Person, error)

which could be tested like

    p, err := NewPersonFromFile(strings.NewReader(`{"name":"Andrew"}`))

Things get tricky when testing the integration of your code with code in 
another repository. You are not responsible for the design of this code. It may 
be very unfriendly to testing. Perhaps it only works if you provide a working 
database instance, or some other complex resource.

These are the important and unavoidable cases when your testing environment 
must get (uncomfortably) more complicated than what is provided by `go test`. 
This is when we resort to integration tests.

# Writing Integration Tests for Minimal Impact

While writing integration tests, we must be vigilant in maintaining the 
ease-of-use and performance of our developer workflow. I'll illustrate some 
strategies with an example.

Let's say we are testing the integration of our service with PostgreSQL, a 
popular database. Before we added PostgreSQL to our project, we ran our unit 
tests with:

    go test ./...

To test integration with our new PostgreSQL component, we prepend a command:

    docker-compose up -d && go test ./...

with the following `docker-compose.yml`:

    db:
      image: postgres:9.6
      ports: [‘5432:5432’]

This provides our tests with a PostgreSQL instance contained in a Docker image.

## Why Docker?

Why are we using a Docker image for this? Why not just run a PostgreSQL server 
on our development machine? There's a few reasons.

Firstly, we improve developer portability by simplifying development 
environment setup. If we required a developer to provide a PostgreSQL server 
running on their development machine, they would need to:
1. install PostgreSQL
1. configure PostgreSQL to provide the appropriate roles, passwords, and 
databases for the test environment
1. launch the server and keep it running

A PostgreSQL Docker container, on the other hand, can be completely configured 
on the command-line (`docker run ...`) or, in our case, in a 
`docker-compose.yml`. The user need not install PostgreSQL: Docker will pull 
the requisite images for them.

Lastly, Docker images are easy to start, stop, destroy, and restart. It's easy 
to guarantee that the PostgreSQL instance will have a fresh state for a test 
case to run on.

A PostgreSQL server running on the host, however, may be used by other 
applications on the developer's machine. It's hard to know what state the 
server will have before a test case runs.

## Why Docker Compose?

Why do we use `docker-compose` instead of `docker run`? We have a few reasons.

A `docker-compose.yml` file is a readable way of configuring Docker containers. 
For example, if we need our PostgreSQL instance to provide a database with the 
name `my-database`, we can have

    db:
      image: postgres:9.6
      ports: ['5432:5432']
      environment:
        POSTGRES_DB: my-database

Also, Docker containers launched via Docker Compose are named according to 
the filepath of the `docker-compose.yml` from which they are launched. A 
`postgres` image launched by your project's `docker-compose.yml` will not 
conflict with any other `postgres` images running on a development machine.

Finally, the `docker-compose` command has subcommands for interacting with 
containers launched from the respective `docker-compose.yml`. This allows you 
to get precise results from the containers you care about. For example, while 
`docker ps` will present information about all of the containers running on 
your system, `docker-compose ps` only presents the containers in your 
`docker-compose.yml`.

In this way, launching containers via `docker-compose` provides automatic 
organization of your containers per-project, and eases the operation and 
analysis of these containers.

# Back to the example, how do we maintain a rapid develop-test-evaluate loop?

Integration tests are necessary for keeping trust in a CI/CD workflow, but they 
seriously hamper a developer's ability to iterate on their unit test suite. 
While a system can run hundreds of unit tests in parallel at a lightning-fast 
pace, even just a few integration tests can slow testing down to minutes.

The solution is easy: only run the integration tests when you need to. To run our
unit tests, we

    go test $$(go list ./... | grep -v -e integration)

To run our integration tests, we

    docker-compose up -d && go test ./integration/...

Here we separate our integration tests into an `integration` package and 
eliminate that package from our unit-test command.

In this way a developer may run a (hopefully) comprehensive unit test suite 
with their unit-test command and get back results immediately. They also have an
integration-test command to be used for the rare moments when they require a new contract from their
dependencies. Or, this command could be run exclusively by CI.

# Look forward to Part 2

That's all for now, but in Part 2 I'll explain a useful tactic for avoiding 
integration tests altogether. Look forward to it!
