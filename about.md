I develop clean, flexible and reliable code to meet today's business objectives immediately and to be ready to change
for whatever tomorrow will bring. I pride myself on constantly considering the latest technologies for solving new and
existing problems in a more efficient manner. I believe it is possible to write code so cleanly that any experienced
engineer can understand the code and contribute to it in less than day's study. I strive to meet these ideals with
every line of code that I write.

I have experience in a variety of business settings, including being the primary developer for an Anti-Money Laundering
deployment (Palantir, 2015-2016), transforming the Raspberry Pi into an HDMI test device (Google, 2014), and creating
an innovative storage product that promises to make latency a thing of the past (Cloudflare, 2018). My work has also
taken me around the globe, from Seoul to Singapore and San Francisco to New York.

I now reside in Austin, Texas not far from my alma mater, the University of Texas at Austin. I am always excited to
hear about new applications of software engineering to solve our everyday problems and to meet humanity's most critical
challenges. If you think I'd be a good fit for your team, please don't hesitate to contact me on
