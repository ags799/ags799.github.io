I develop clean, flexible and reliable code to meet today's business objectives immediately and to be ready to change
for whatever tomorrow will bring. I pride myself on constantly considering the latest technologies for solving new and
existing problems in a more efficient manner. I believe it is possible to write code so cleanly that any experienced
engineer can understand the code and contribute to it in less than day's study. I strive to meet these ideals with
every line that I write.
